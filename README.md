## Introduction

### Rules

word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word  
are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

As letters in the word are guessed, choose and write letter in terminal.  
If a letter not in the word is guess, you will see picture of a person on the  
gallowsâ€“one part for each incorrect letter guess. Most frequently, the person  
is drawn in 7 parts (for 7 letter guesses) in the order: gallows, head, body,  
left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm, rope.
